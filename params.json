The people of Athens lived below the Acropolis (rocky hill). The marble Parthenon, a temple, (see picture above) was built on the highest part of the Acropolis.\r\n## Wars\r\n### The Most Important Battles Of Ancient Greece: Battle of Marathon, 490 BC. The Battle of Marathon took place during the first Persian invasion of Greece, fought between the combined forces of Athens and Plataea against King Darius' Persian army.\r\n## Slaves\r\n### Slavery played a major role in ancient Greek civilization. Slaves could be found everywhere. They worked not only as domestic servants, but as factory workers, shopkeepers, Mineworkers, farm workers and as ship's crewmembers. There may have been as many, if not more, slaves than free people in ancient Greece\r\n## Medicine\r\n### Hippocrates, known as the \"Father of Modern Medicine\", established a medical school at Cos and is the most important figure in ancient Greek medicine. Hippocrates and his students documented numerous illnesses in the Hippocratic Corpus, and developed the Hippocratic Oath for physicians, which is still in use today.\r\n## Farming\r\n### Farming in ancient Greece was difficult due to the limited amount of good soil and cropland. It is estimated that only twenty percent of the land was usable for growing crops. The main crops were barley, grapes, and olives. Grain crops, such as barley and wheat, were planted in October and harvested in April or May.\r\n![Ancient Greece Farming](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-urYD1iWHDaA/VbpRNSk6vrI/AAAAAAAAJrg/mxSyb11q-9Q/s1600/g4.png)",
